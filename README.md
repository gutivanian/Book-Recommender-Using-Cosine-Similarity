# Book-Recommender-Using-Cosine-Similarity
----
In this project, I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given book dataset. In addition, I also created an algorithm that can recommend books based on 3 favorite books and authors inputted by the user.

In the data cleaning stage, I took several steps such as removing duplicate data, filling in missing values, and performing some data transformations such as changing date formats and creating a genre column. Then, I conducted EDA to gain a deeper understanding of the book dataset used. I analyzed descriptive statistics, genre distributions, and visualized data to obtain more comprehensive information about the dataset.

After that, I created an algorithm that can recommend books based on 3 favorite books and authors inputted by the user. This algorithm takes data from the book dataset and uses information about authors and genres to recommend books that the user might like. This algorithm can recommend a number of books based on user preferences.

In this project, I also created a Jupyter notebook that covers all stages from data cleaning, EDA, to algorithm creation. Additionally, I included a readme file that contains detailed information about this project. I hope that this project can be useful for anyone who is interested in recommending books based on their preferences.
